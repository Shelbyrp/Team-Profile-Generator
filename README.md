## Description
This application has been created so that it takes input from the user about employees from the command line and generates a HTML webpage that displays a short summary for each person. To ensure that the code is maintainable, tests have been used. 

For ease of use, the email of the team members will open a new email with the TO field populated and a Github link is available for the engineers.

To create this application, the Inquirer package was used and Jest to allow for tests. JavaScript has been utilised to create the program also.

 Here is a link to a demo video with a detailed description of how to use this application: [demo video](https://youtu.be/VzmHMKuU32I)
